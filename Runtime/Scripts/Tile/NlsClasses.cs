            // Data content: The input information of Laser scanning data 0.5 p is Laser scanning data 5 p, which has the following characteristics:

            // The point cloud has been quality checked and processed as well as possible to form the foundation
            // for the nationwide elevation model and to be suitable for the needs of the nationwide forest classification.
            // The classifications of point clouds have been implemented as automatic classifications.
            // The classifications of air points or error points mentioned below have mainly been done automatically,
            // and in practice they are never fully comprehensive. Other users of the data can filter and classify the data according to their own needs.

            // The point density (pulse density, i.e.outgoing laser pulses per square metre) is comprehensively at least 5 points/m²,
            // i.e.the distance between laser points on the ground is on average no more than approx. 0.40 m.

            // but it depends on the type of scanner and the settings of each scanning flight.

                                // all the laser points are in this class. After classification,
                                // this class includes all the points whose class has not changed in the classification process.

                                // if there are 10 or fewer other points within a radius of 5 metres from the point.
                                // Some laser points from real features, such as points from power lines,
                                // or tree trunks in an open forest, are also included in this class.

                                // These points are according to the automatic classification statistically too low
                                // compared to the points in their surroundings.They can be due to e.g.scanner faults,
                                // multiple reflections of the laser pulse, or an incorrect separation of the return echo in the scanning system.

                                // The result depends on the values chosen for the parameters of the classification algorithm,
                                // and it is always a compromise between the number of points not belonging to the surface of the ground

            // Due to the spacing out, the horizontal distribution of points is as even as possible.The average horizontal distance
            // between points is approx. 1.4 m, in limited areas approx.1.8 m.

            // The point classes are otherwise the same as in the original Laser scanning data 5 p,
            // but all fault point classes have been deleted before the spacing out.

            // The spacing out has been done with Terra Solid's TerraScan programme,

            // and other return echoes related to the corresponding input pulses are chosen.
